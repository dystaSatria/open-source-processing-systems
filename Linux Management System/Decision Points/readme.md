### Decision Points in Specifying Computer Systems

#### Role
- **Desktop Usage**: Ideal for productivity applications and web browsing with a user-friendly desktop interface.
- **Server Usage**: Best for remote access and services, typically managed via CLI to optimize resources for serving information.

#### Function
- Consider the specific software requirements and functions.
- Assess the scale (number of machines) and the managing team's skill set.

#### Life Cycle
- Importance of understanding the service lifetime and risk tolerance.
- Maintenance and release cycles impact on enterprise server environment decisions.

#### Modern Solutions
- Virtualization: Reduces physical space and power requirements, automates tasks, and minimizes manual intervention.
- Cloud Services: Examples include Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, and Microsoft Azure, reducing the need for physical hardware upgrades.

#### Stability
- **Beta**: New, untested features.
- **Stable**: Tested and reliable for production servers, unless specific features necessitate beta versions.

#### Compatibility
- Backward compatibility is crucial for upgrading operating systems without needing to update applications due to cost or availability constraints.

#### Cost
- Considerations include licensing fees, hardware availability, staff skills, maintenance costs, and future requirements.

#### Interface Evolution
- From physical switches and plugboards to punch cards and text-based terminals.
- The transition to graphical user interfaces (GUIs) pioneered by Xerox PARC and popularized by Apple.

### Quick Memorization Points
- **Desktop vs. Server**: Know the intended roleâ€”desktop for direct interaction, server for remote services.
- **Functionality**: Understand the required software and capacity.
- **Life Cycle Awareness**: Keep maintenance and release cycles in mind for cost and efficiency.
- **Embrace Modern IT**: Leverage virtualization and cloud services for scalability and cost-effectiveness.
- **Stability Choice**: Beta for cutting-edge features, stable for reliability.
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Prioritize backward compatibility for smooth upgrades.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Balance initial and ongoing costs with IT needs.
- **Interface Knowledge**: Be aware of interface evolution and its impact on user experience.
